## About
My first RAT experiment when I was in elementary school. It's written in **Visual Basic** 6.

- It DOES NOT support up-to-date systems.
- It's detected by most of antivirus software.

## Usage
```
When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing.
Now, only God knows.
```
- **PLEASE DO NOT USE IT, IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE**
- If you have *Visual Basic 6* on your computer you may try to build it but I do not suggest you to do that.
